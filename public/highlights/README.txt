Drop the 3 Juan Franco profile highlight screenshots here.

Expected filenames (update ProfileView if you change them):
- juan-franco-1.png
- juan-franco-2.png
- juan-franco-3.png

In Vite, files in /public are served at the site root, so these will be available as:
/highlights/juan-franco-1.png
/highlights/juan-franco-2.png
/highlights/juan-franco-3.png
